## Description:
<p>
This line-follower car is an autonomous robot which follows a black line in a white area. It is able to detect a particular line and keep following it using multiple infrared sensors. Based on the input from the sensors (1 means that the sensor is over a black surface, 0 means that the sensor is over a white surface) the robot is centered on the black line by coordinating the motors.
